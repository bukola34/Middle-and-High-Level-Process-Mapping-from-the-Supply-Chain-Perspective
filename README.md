# Middle-and-High-Level-Process-Mapping-from-the-Supply-Chain-Perspective
Process mapping examples that showcase upstream vendor sourcing and downstream order fulfillment in the Supply Chain. 

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how **Business Analysis techniques**—specifically **process mapping**—can be applied to real-world supply chain workflows. By visualizing processes end-to-end, stakeholders gain clarity, alignment, and actionable insights for improvement.  

The work here is inspired by frameworks outlined in *“How to Create a Simple Process Map (With Examples)” on YouTube*, adapted into two practical process maps:  

1. **Request for Proposal (RFP) Process – Mid-Level**  
2. **Order-to-Cash (O2C) Process – High-Level**

##  1. Request for Proposal (RFP) Process – Mid-Level  
This map captures the **upstream supply chain process** of engaging and selecting vendors.  

### Key Highlights:  
- **End-to-End Journey**: From identifying the need to engage a vendor through issuing RFPs, evaluating proposals, and finalizing contracts.  
- **Cost Thresholds**: Showed how <$100K vs. ≥$100K impact the approval paths and procurement involvement.  
- **Cross-Functional Steps**: Illustrated collaboration between **Line of Business (LOB)** requesters and **procurement** teams.  
- **Vendor Types**: Mapped compliance requirements for new, preferred, and local vendors with/without Master Service Agreements (MSAs).  

**Value**: Acts as both a **storytelling tool** and a **decision-making aid**, ensuring vendor qualification, cost efficiency, and risk mitigation.

## 2. Order-to-Cash (O2C) Process – High-Level  
This map represents the **downstream supply chain process** of customer order fulfillment.  

### Key Highlights:  
- **Order Capture**: Multiple entry points including portals, email, EDI, and fax.  
- **Cross-Functional Flow**: Integrated interactions across **customer service, finance, and supply chain teams**.  
- **Fulfillment Steps**: From order validation, pricing, and credit checks to warehouse picking, transport, delivery, billing, and closure.  
- **Big-Picture View**: Surfaces opportunities for process improvements such as automation of manual entries or ERP-logistics integration.  

**Value**: Demonstrates how supply chain reliability directly impacts customer satisfaction and financial performance.

## Supply Chain Perspective  
- **RFP Process (Upstream)**: Ensures sourcing reliability, cost optimization, and compliance before execution.  
- **O2C Process (Downstream)**: Ensures smooth delivery, order visibility, and customer satisfaction.  

Together, they form a **closed-loop system**:  
- Strong vendor management (RFP) ➝ Reliable order fulfillment (O2C).  
- Customer outcomes validate supplier selection strategies.  

---

## Stakeholder Benefits  
- **Finance**: Reduced disputes, improved forecasting.  
- **Customers**: Faster, transparent service.  
- **Procurement & Supply Chain**: Streamlined vendor onboarding, fulfillment visibility.  
- **Leadership**: Data-driven insights, clear accountability, compliance assurance.

## Conclusion  
This project highlights my ability to:  
- Apply **Business Analysis skills** (process mapping, stakeholder alignment).  
- Translate workflows into **visual storytelling tools**.  
- Provide both **high-level and mid-level process perspectives**.  

By leveraging structured mapping (inspired by *“How to Create a Simple Process Map (With Examples)”*), these deliverables showcase how supply chain operations can be visualized for **transformation, decision-making, and continuous improvement**.
